Please follow the instructions to run the codes properly

1.Compile the necessary FORTRAN programs (reftrg2, nettrg2 and rfrmsrch2) and save it your program directory

        ==> inside "main" directory, triggering executable progams are located 
        ==> use makefile to execute reftrg2 and nettrg2 program
        ==> execute "rfrmsrch2" located under "reorg" dirctory
        ==> move all those to your program directory 
        ==> also save the "autofilch5" sac macro to the prgram directory                           

 
2.Prepare the day long sac file organized by station hierarchy
 
3. Run trigger.csh script ( inside the scripts, change the program and data directory accordingly)
      
       ==> data directory should contain all stations with the daylong sacfile inside 
       ==> change the STA, LTA, STA/LTA and other parameters if needed

4. Done. "triggered_events" file will contain all the detected triggered events

Hope this intructions will help.
 

Good luck!!
