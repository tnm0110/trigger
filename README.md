# trigger

This repository contains automatic event detection based on STA/LTA algorithom. This codes runs day-long sac files to detect possible seismic events.
"trigger.csh" is the main shell script to run the codes. It first run reftrg to detect events on individual stations and then run nettrg to look for possible event match between the stations.
Event should be organized by station direcotry hierarchy
I have included a exmple folder to test the codes. 

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or have questions.
